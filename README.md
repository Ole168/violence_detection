# Violence Detection using VGG16 network
This is a Computer Vision project which aims to classify images containing violence.<br>Major Tech Stack:<br>->TensorFlow 2.1.0<br>->OpenCV


# How to use?
Note: To maintain the ennvironments, I highly recommend using [conda](https://anaconda.org/).
```
git clone https://github.com/aitikgupta/violence_detection.git
cd violence_detection
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate {environment name, for eg. conda activate cv}
jupyter notebook Violence_Detection.ipynb
```

## About the model:

The model is built using TensorFlow 2.1.0 with 1.5 hours training on GeForce GTX-1650 GPU. Last 4 layers of the VGG16 pretrained network were fine tuned, along with fully-connected layers.


#### Application:

Given image â†’ find object name in the image
It can detect any one of 1000 images
It takes input image of size 224 * 224 * 3 (RGB image)
Built using:

Convolutions layers (used only 3*3 size )
Max pooling layers (used only 2*2 size)
Fully connected layers at end
Total 16 layers
#### Model size:
528MB

#### Pre trained model(Tensorflow):
